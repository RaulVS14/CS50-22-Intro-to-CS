                <h5>Friendly greetings!</h5>
                <p>I was named Raul by my parents. Early in life I was
                    interested in taking things apart and figuring out how
                    things worked.</p>
                <p>Childhood was in the theme of helping other people and
                    solving problems for others.<br>I got my fair share of
                    scrapes, bruises and scars. Inquisitive mind comes with its
                    dangers after all.</p>
                <p>The school was such a fun place for my curious soul. I found
                    few friends, alot to learn and technology. <br>One time I
                    was hidden away in computer class till 8 o'clock in the
                    evening. Playing computer games and trying to solve problems
                    in quests</p>
                <p>After that I was hooked by computers. I remember truly
                    enjoying animating car in the Word.</p>
                <p>After high school in the university I discovered programming.<br>
                    I found it really cool, because it was like magic - write a
                    code and solve calculation assignment what took few days in
                    an instant.</p>
                <p>I followed my interest through different curriculums -
                    physics, computer technology, technotronics.<br> Never quite
                    finding the right one.</p>
                <p>After a while I landed in the Tartu vocational school,
                    learning
                    web specialist specialty. HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and SQL.
                    <br>It came with some challenges, but I managed to graduate.
                </p>
                <p>New found skills obtained I managed to get job as a front-end
                    developer in building guide company. I got to meet with
                    clients and create user-interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>Next job was STACC. It was quite different and with some new
                    technologies. I applied for PHP dev, and I got to work on
                    Magento plugin.<br>After the plugin was discontinued I moved
                    on to full-stack development with Django, which is Python
                    framework for web applications</p>
                <p>I continue learning and gaining new experience. In 2022,
                    working on CS50 course, learning C and algorithms.</p>
